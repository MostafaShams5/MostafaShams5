AI & Data Science

### The Builds

**[EgyLated: English ↔ Egyptian Arabic Translator](https://huggingface.co/Shams03/EgyLated)**
Standard translation tools struggle with dialects. I built a custom AI model from scratch specifically designed to understand and translate Egyptian Arabic (Masri), bridging the gap where big models fail.

**[Research: Accuracy Without Profit](https://doi.org/10.32388/7A61RS)**
A research paper exploring the "Accuracy Paradox" in data science. I used statistical analysis on 21 years of data to prove that a model with higher predictive accuracy can sometimes lead to worse financial outcomes in real-world betting markets.

**[FISH-Tuning Implementation](https://github.com/MostafaShams5/fish-tuning-implementation)**
A PyTorch implementation of the research paper "Enhancing PEFT Methods with Fisher Information." It uses math (Fisher Information) to figure out exactly which parameters in a model matter most, allowing for smarter, more efficient fine-tuning.
